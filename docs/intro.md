# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->

# 🧠🤖 Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the future of AI — where **digital intelligence meets the physical world**.

This course is designed to help you understand and build **embodied AI systems** that interact with real environments, move like humans, and think like autonomous agents.  
Here, you will learn to bridge the gap between:

- **Digital Brain (AI Models)**
- **Physical Body (Humanoid Robots)**

---

## 🚀 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI is a new domain where artificial intelligence is not just running on servers —  
it **lives inside physical machines**, interacts with the environment, understands physics, and performs real-world tasks.

You will explore:

- Perception systems (vision, sensors)
- Motion planning
- Robotics control
- Humanoid simulation
- Real-time decision making

---

## ⚙️ Course Goal

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to:

✔ Control humanoid robots in simulation  
✔ Use AI models to guide physical actions  
✔ Understand robotic structure & locomotion  
✔ Work with ROS2, Gazebo, and simulation tools  
✔ Build end-to-end embodied intelligence systems  

This is your first step toward becoming a **Physical AI Engineer**.

---

## 🧩 Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Version 20 or above)
- A modern code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript
- Basic AI/ML understanding (optional but helpful)

---

## 🏗️ Setting Up the Course Environment

Create your documentation site using Docusaurus:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest physical-ai classic
